# Connect to serial port of Onion Omega2+
If you are like me, you purchased a PowerDock 2 and for some reason, the manufacturer decided not to include Serial0 on thier fancy breakout header.  Would have been nice if they designed the pins fit into a standard size breadboard like many other dev boards...

So I decided to just solder on a couple of wires to the RX0 TX0 pins on the PowerDock 2 so that I can use my own 3v3 USB-SERIAL converter.  Thanks Onion Omega!
